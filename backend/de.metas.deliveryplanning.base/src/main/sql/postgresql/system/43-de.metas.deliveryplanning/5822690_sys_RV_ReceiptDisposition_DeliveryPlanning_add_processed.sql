-- Adds Processed to RV_ReceiptDisposition_DeliveryPlanning -- the shared blocker on both row types (owner, 2026-09-04):
-- "Processed is shown as itself: it is the shared blocker on both the schedule and the planning, set
-- for delivered and for closed alike." Sourced per branch, identity/context style, same reasoning as
-- QtyToMove/IsConfirmedBySupplier two scripts above -- the planning's own Processed on a planned row
-- (dp.processed), the schedule's own Processed on an unplanned row (rs.processed). Both tables already
-- carry a real, stored Processed column (AD_Column 585273 / 549513, both backed by AD_Element 1047),
-- so this is a plain per-branch column read, not a derived expression and not a new virtual column.
--
-- NOT a readiness or status column: Processed is a plain flag shown as itself, nothing more. The
-- receipt process's own preconditions still decide actionability, exactly as IsPlanned's header
-- comment (5822570) already established for that flag.
--
-- Grain/key are unaffected: dp.processed and rs.processed are existing scalar columns on the two
-- tables this view already selects from (no new join, no new table, no fan-out possible). Verified
-- after applying: still 343 rows (same as before this script), still a unique key, and
-- "GROUP BY RV_ReceiptDisposition_DeliveryPlanning_ID HAVING count(*) > 1" returns zero rows.
