-- Add CalendarWeek, derived from the SAME expression that computes ETA on each branch -- not from
-- either bare source column. M_ReceiptSchedule already carries its own CalendarWeek (window 541954,
-- ColumnSQL over MovementDate/DatePromised_Override directly); that column stays untouched. Reading
-- straight from that column here would let the week disagree with the ETA shown right next to it on a
-- planned row, since a planning's own ETA can differ from its schedule once edited.
--
-- EXTRACT(week from ...) is the ISO week, so a date whose ISO week crosses a year boundary correctly
-- reports the week of the ISO year it belongs to, not the calendar year (e.g. 2023-01-01, a Sunday, is
-- week 52 of ISO year 2022). No separate ISO-year column: the grid sorts by ETA, not grouped by week.
--
-- Grain/key are unaffected: no join added, this only extracts a field from a value already computed
-- in the SELECT list. Verified after applying: still the same row count, still a unique key, and
-- "GROUP BY RV_ReceiptDisposition_DeliveryPlanning_ID HAVING count(*) > 1" returns zero rows.
