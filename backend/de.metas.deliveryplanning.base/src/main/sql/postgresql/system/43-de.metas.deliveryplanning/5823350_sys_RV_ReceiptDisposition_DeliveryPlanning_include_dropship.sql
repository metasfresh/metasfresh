-- Widens branch one (the "planned" branch) of RV_ReceiptDisposition_DeliveryPlanning from
-- transportdirection = 'Incoming' to IN ('Incoming', 'Dropship'). Owner ruling 2026-09-09: "include
-- dropship, filter should be isIncomingOrDropship". REQUIREMENTS.md AC2 now reads "Outgoing rows and
-- shipment schedules do not appear" - Outgoing is the only direction this window excludes.
--
-- This is a consistency fix, not a scope widening. Three things say so:
--   * de.metas.deliveryplanning.base already pairs the two directions at every one of its ten decision
--     points, through TransportDirection#isIncomingOrDropship(). The view's '= Incoming' was the only
--     place in the feature singling Incoming out - grep that method name for the others.
--   * A dropship planning is created by the INCOMING generate command - GenerateIncomingDeliveryPlanningCommand
--     reads order.isDropShip() ? Dropship : Incoming - so it carries a receipt schedule by construction, which
--     is the one fact this view's planned branch needs.
--   * Measured on the deep_tundra_release local DB 2026-09-09, active plannings by direction (count / with a
--     receipt schedule / with a shipment schedule): Dropship 112 / 112 / 0, Incoming 1192 / 1192 / 0, Outgoing
--     1848 / 0 / 1848. Dropship is receipt-side in the real data; Outgoing has no receipt schedule to select.
--
-- Branch two is untouched and needs no change: it already excludes every schedule that has ANY active planning,
-- dropship ones included, so no row moves between the branches. Grain and key are unaffected - no join, no
-- table and no column changes, only which m_delivery_planning rows the WHERE admits. Re-verified after
-- applying, same DB: 1794 rows, 1304 planned + 490 unplanned, 1794 distinct keys, no key appearing twice, and
-- 112 dropship rows - equal to the 112 counted straight off m_delivery_planning, without the view.
--
-- Consequence deliberately accepted: the window's ~15 receipt actions become available on dropship rows. They
-- are coherent there - each defers to ReceiptScheduleReceiveEligibility.check(), which keys on the receipt
-- schedule's IsClosed / IsPackagingMaterial and knows nothing of direction, so a dropship row is offered
-- exactly what the receipt-schedule window would offer for the same schedule.
