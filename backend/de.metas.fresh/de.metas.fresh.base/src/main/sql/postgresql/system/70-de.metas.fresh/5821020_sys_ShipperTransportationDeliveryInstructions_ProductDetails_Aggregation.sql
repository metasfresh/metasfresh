-- Deliver-instruction report functions no longer assume exactly one M_Delivery_Planning per
-- M_ShipperTransportation: several plannings can now be aggregated onto one instruction via
-- M_Delivery_Planning_Alloc, each with its own M_ShippingPackage.
--
-- docs_deliveryinstructions_productdetails: aggregates one row per M_Product_ID across all active
-- allocations of the instruction (previously one row per allocation). Column set and types are
-- unchanged, so CREATE OR REPLACE is sufficient.
--
-- docs_deliveryinstructions_description: drops orderno/referenceno. Those came from the single
-- C_Order behind the arbitrarily-picked "first" planning, which is not a meaningful concept once
-- several orders/plannings can stand behind one instruction. Dropping the columns removes the whole
-- planning/order join from the function, so it changes the RETURNS TABLE signature -- this needs
-- DROP FUNCTION before CREATE because CREATE OR REPLACE cannot change a return type.
