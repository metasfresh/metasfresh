Feature: effort issue interaction with effort control

  Background:
    Given infrastructure and metasfresh are running
    And the existing user with login 'metasfresh' receives a random a API token for the existing role with name 'WebUI'
    And metasfresh has date and time 2022-09-22T13:30:13+01:00[Europe/Berlin]
    And set sys config boolean value true for sys config SKIP_WP_PROCESSOR_FOR_AUTOMATION

    And create or update C_Project:
      | C_Project_ID.Identifier | Name               | Value              | C_Currency_ID.ISO_Code |
      | testProject             | testProject_220922 | testProject_220922 | EUR                    |
    And metasfresh contains AD_Users:
