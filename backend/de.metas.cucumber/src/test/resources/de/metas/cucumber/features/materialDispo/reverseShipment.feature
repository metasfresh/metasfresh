Feature: Shipping HUs interaction with material schedule

  Background:
    Given the existing user with login 'metasfresh' receives a random a API token for the existing role with name 'WebUI'
    And metasfresh has date and time 2021-04-11T08:00:00+01:00[Europe/Berlin]
    And set sys config boolean value true for sys config SKIP_WP_PROCESSOR_FOR_AUTOMATION
    And AD_Scheduler for classname 'de.metas.material.cockpit.stock.process.MD_Stock_Update_From_M_HUs' is disabled
    And metasfresh initially has no MD_Candidate data
