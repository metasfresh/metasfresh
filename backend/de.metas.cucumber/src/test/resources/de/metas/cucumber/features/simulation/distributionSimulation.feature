      | p_1        |
    And metasfresh contains M_PricingSystems
      | Identifier |

      | location_1 | bPLocation_1 | bpartner_1               |
    And load M_Warehouse:
      | M_Warehouse_ID | Value        |
      | warehouseStd   | StdWarehouse |
    And metasfresh contains M_Warehouse:
      | M_Warehouse_ID | C_BPartner_ID | C_BPartner_Location_ID | IsInTransit |

      | M_Locator_ID | Value    | M_Warehouse_ID |
      | locator_1    | Standard | warehouse_2    |
    And contains M_Shippers
      | Identifier |
      | shipper_1  |
    And metasfresh contains DD_NetworkDistribution
      | Identifier  |
      | ddNetwork_1 |
    And metasfresh contains DD_NetworkDistributionLine
      | DD_NetworkDistributionLine_ID | DD_NetworkDistribution_ID | M_Warehouse_ID | M_WarehouseSource_ID | M_Shipper_ID |
      | ddNetworkLine_1               | ddNetwork_1               | warehouseStd   | warehouse_2          | shipper_1    |

    And metasfresh contains C_Orders:
      | Identifier | IsSOTrx | C_BPartner_ID | DateOrdered | PreparationDate      | M_Warehouse_ID |
      | o_1        | true    | bpartner_1    | 2022-07-04  | 2022-07-04T00:00:00Z | warehouseStd   |
    And metasfresh contains C_OrderLines:
      | Identifier | C_Order_ID | M_Product_ID | QtyEntered |
      | ol_1       | o_1        | p_1          | 14         |
    And create and process 'simulated demand' for:
      | C_Order_ID | C_OrderLine_ID |
      | o_1        | ol_1           |
    And after not more than 60s, the MD_Candidate table has only the following records
      | Identifier | MD_Candidate_Type | MD_Candidate_BusinessCase | M_Product_ID | DateProjected        | Qty | ATP | simulated |
      | c_1        | DEMAND            | SHIPMENT                  | p_1          | 2022-07-04T00:00:00Z | -14 | -14 | true      |

    And after not more than 60s, following DD_Order_Candidates are found
      | Identifier | M_Product_ID | M_Warehouse_From_ID | M_WarehouseTo_ID | Qty    | Processed | IsSimulated | C_OrderLineSO_ID |
      | c1         | p_1          | warehouse_2         | warehouseStd     | 14 PCE | N         | Y           | ol_1             |
    And delete C_OrderLine identified by ol_1, but keep its id into identifierIds table
    And no DD_Order_Candidates found for product p_1
