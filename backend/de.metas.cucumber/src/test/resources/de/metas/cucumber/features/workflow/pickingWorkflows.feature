  Background:
    Given infrastructure and metasfresh are running
    And the existing user with login 'metasfresh' receives a random a API token for the existing role with name 'WebUI'
    And metasfresh has date and time 2022-08-18T13:30:13+01:00[Europe/Berlin]
    And set sys config boolean value true for sys config SKIP_WP_PROCESSOR_FOR_AUTOMATION

    And the existing user with login 'testUser_17497' receives a random a API token for the existing role with name 'WebUI'
    And store workflow endpointPath api/v2/userWorkflows/wfProcess/:wf1/continue in context
    And a 'POST' request is sent to metasfresh REST-API with endpointPath from context and fulfills with '200' status code
    And validate M_ShipmentSchedule_Lock record for
      | M_ShipmentSchedule_ID.Identifier | Login          | Exists |
      | pickingShipmentSchedule          | testUser_17497 | Y      |
    And create JsonPickingEventsList and store it in context as request payload:
      | WorkflowProcess.Identifier | WorkflowActivity.Identifier | PickingLine.Identifier | HUQRCode.Identifier | QtyPicked |
      | wf1                        | a1                          | line1                  | huToPickQR          | 1         |
    And the metasfresh REST-API endpoint path 'api/v2/picking/event' receives a 'POST' request with the payload from context and responds with '200' status code
    And store workflow endpointPath api/v2/userWorkflows/wfProcess/:wf1/:CompletePickingActivity/userConfirmation in context
    And a 'POST' request is sent to metasfresh REST-API with endpointPath from context and fulfills with '200' status code
    Then after not more than 60s, M_InOut is found:
