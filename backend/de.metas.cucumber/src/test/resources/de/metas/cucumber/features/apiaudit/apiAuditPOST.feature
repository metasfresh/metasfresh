Feature: API Audit POST http method

  Background:
    Given the existing user with login 'metasfresh' receives a random a API token for the existing role with name 'WebUI'
    And all the API audit data is reset

  @from:cucumber
  Scenario: Testcase 100, normal POST and caller waits for result
    And the following API_Audit_Config records are created:

    Then the actual response body is
