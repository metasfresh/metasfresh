Feature: keep in sync issue cost center and cost center label

  Background:
    Given infrastructure and metasfresh are running
    And the existing user with login 'metasfresh' receives a random a API token for the existing role with name 'WebUI'
    And metasfresh has date and time 2022-09-21T13:30:13+01:00[Europe/Berlin]
    And set sys config boolean value true for sys config SKIP_WP_PROCESSOR_FOR_AUTOMATION

  @from:cucumber
  Scenario: given there is an existing issue without cost center, set a cost center activity and check label is set
    And metasfresh contains S_Issue:
