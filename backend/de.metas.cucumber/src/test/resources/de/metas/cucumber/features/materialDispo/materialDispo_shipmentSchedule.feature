Feature: material-dispo updates on shipment-schedule events
  As a user
  I want material dispo to be updated properly if shipment-schedules are created
  So that the ATP is always correct

  @from:cucumber
  @topic:materialdispo
  Scenario: shipment-schedule without stock or ATP
    Given metasfresh initially has no MD_Candidate data
    When metasfresh receives a ShipmentScheduleCreatedEvent
      | M_Product_ID | M_ShipmentSchedule_ID | PreparationDate         | Qty |
      | 2005577      | 123                   | 2020-12-12T23:59:00.00Z | 10  |
    Then metasfresh has this MD_Candidate data
      | Identifier | Type   | BusinessCase | M_Product_ID | Time                    | DisplayQty | ATP |
      | c_1        | DEMAND | SHIPMENT     | 2005577      | 2020-12-12T23:59:00.00Z | -10        | -10 |
      | c_2        | SUPPLY |              | 2005577      | 2020-12-12T23:59:00.00Z | 10         | 0   |
    And metasfresh has this MD_Candidate_Demand_Detail data
      | MD_Candidate_ID.Identifier | M_ShipmentSchedule_ID |
      | c_1                        | 123                   |
