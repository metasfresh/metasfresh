Feature: DD_Order replenishment — create a distribution order for a packing-warehouse sales order
  As a warehouse operator running a packing workplace ("Packtisch"),
  I want every sales-order line on a packing warehouse to automatically get exactly one
  Completed distribution order moving the goods from the stocking warehouse to the packing warehouse,
  so that the picker always has a DD_Order to work from without manual planning.

  Scenario: One Completed DD_Order is created when a shipment-schedule line is assigned to a workstation
    # The stocking warehouse holds the goods; the packing warehouse is where the picker delivers them.
    # The packing warehouse is flagged IsAutoDistributionOrder=Y and excluded from material-dispo (MRP_Exclude=Y),
    # so the dedicated reconcile flow (not material-dispo) drives DD_Order creation.

    And complete inventory with inventoryIdentifier 'stockInventory'
    And after not more than 60s, there are added M_HUs for inventory

    # The shipment schedule is generated on order completion. No DD_Order yet — the trigger is now the

  Scenario: No DD_Order is created when the initial assignment has QtyToPick=0 (CREATE→NONE soft no-op)
    # A brand-new assignment with QtyToPick=0 fires the M_Picking_Job_Schedule afterNew reconcile, but
    # the zero-qty soft no-op guard sees REQUIRED=∅ (nothing to plan) and EXISTING=∅ (no DD_Order yet),
    # so the reconcile completes as a no-op — no DD_Order is created and no error is recorded.
