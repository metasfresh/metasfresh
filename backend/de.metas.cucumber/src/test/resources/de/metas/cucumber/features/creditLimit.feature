  Scenario: validate the error thrown by the credit limit set on business partner when generating the shipments,
  then remove the credit limit, generate shipments and validate them

    And the inventory identified by i_1 is completed

    And the user creates a JsonCreateShipmentRequest and stores it in the context

    And wait for 1s

    And the metasfresh REST-API endpoint path 'api/v2/shipments' receives a 'POST' request with the payload from context and responds with '200' status code

    Then validate created M_ShipmentSchedule_QtyPicked records
