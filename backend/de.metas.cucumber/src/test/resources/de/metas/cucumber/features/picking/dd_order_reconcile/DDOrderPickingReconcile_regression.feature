Feature: DD_Order picking reconcile — non-packing warehouses are not touched by the new flow
  As a warehouse operator, I want sales orders on a regular (non-packing) warehouse to keep being handled
  by the existing material-disposition path, with no reconcile event and no distribution order created by
  the new packing-reconcile flow, so the new feature is fully scoped to packing warehouses only.

  Background:
    Given infrastructure and metasfresh are running
    And the existing user with login 'metasfresh' receives a random a API token for the existing role with name 'WebUI'
    And metasfresh has date and time 2022-05-17T13:30:13+01:00[Europe/Berlin]
    And metasfresh contains M_Products:
      | Identifier |
      | product    |
    And metasfresh contains M_PricingSystems
      | Identifier      |
      | pricingSystem   |
    And metasfresh contains M_PriceLists
      | Identifier | M_PricingSystem_ID | C_Country_ID | C_Currency_ID | SOTrx |
      | priceList  | pricingSystem      | DE           | EUR           | true  |
    And metasfresh contains M_PriceList_Versions
      | Identifier      | M_PriceList_ID |
      | priceListVersion | priceList     |
    And metasfresh contains M_ProductPrices
      | M_PriceList_Version_ID | M_Product_ID | PriceStd | C_UOM_ID | C_TaxCategory_ID |
      | priceListVersion       | product      | 10.0     | PCE      | Normal           |
    And metasfresh contains C_BPartners:
      | Identifier | IsVendor | IsCustomer | M_PricingSystem_ID |
      | customer   | N        | Y          | pricingSystem      |
    And metasfresh contains C_BPartner_Locations:
      | Identifier       | GLN          | C_BPartner_ID |
      | customerLocation | bPLocation_1 | customer      |

  @from:cucumber
  Scenario: A sales order on a regular warehouse produces no reconcile DD_Order (TC9)
    # A plain warehouse: IsAutoDistributionOrder=N (default), no MRP_Exclude, no DD_NetworkDistribution.
    Given metasfresh contains M_Warehouse:
      | M_Warehouse_ID | C_BPartner_ID | C_BPartner_Location_ID | IsAutoDistributionOrder |
      | regularWH      | customer      | customerLocation       | N                  |

    When metasfresh contains C_Orders:
      | Identifier | IsSOTrx | C_BPartner_ID | DateOrdered | M_Warehouse_ID |
      | order      | true    | customer      | 2022-05-17  | regularWH      |
    And metasfresh contains C_OrderLines:
      | Identifier | C_Order_ID | M_Product_ID | QtyEntered |
      | orderLine  | order      | product      | 5          |
    And the order identified by order is completed

    Then after not more than 60s, M_ShipmentSchedules are found:
      | Identifier       | C_OrderLine_ID | Warehouse_ID |
      | shipmentSchedule | orderLine      | regularWH    |

    # The new packing-reconcile flow must NOT have fired: no DD_Order is linked to any schedule of this order.
    And there is no reconcile DD_Order for the C_Order order
