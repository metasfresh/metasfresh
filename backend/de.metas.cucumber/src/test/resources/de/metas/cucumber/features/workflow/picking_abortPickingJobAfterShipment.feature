  Scenario: Abort not started picking jobs after shipment
    Given start picking job for sales order identified by salesOrder_17813

      | Identifier | PickingSlot | IsDynamic |
      | 180.0      | 180.0       | Y         |
    And scan picking slot identified by 180.0
    And validate M_PickingSlot:
      | M_PickingSlot_ID.Identifier | C_BPartner_ID.Identifier | C_BPartner_Location_ID.Identifier |
      | 180.0                       | pickingCustomer_17813    | pickingCustomer_17813Location     |

      | pickingShipmentSchedule          | s_1                   |
    And validate single M_ShipmentSchedule_QtyPicked record created for shipment schedule

      | pickingShipmentSchedule          | 10        | true      | false                       | null                  |
    Then after not more than 15s, validate M_PickingSlot:
