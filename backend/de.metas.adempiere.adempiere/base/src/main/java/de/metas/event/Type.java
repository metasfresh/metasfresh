 * The type of the topic or event bus.<br>
 * Notes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Two topics with the same name but different type are different and will <b>always</b> have different event busses. Therefore, events posted to one of of those topics won't be forwarded
 * subscribers of the other one.
 * <li>Creating an {@link IEventBus} for a remote {@link Topic} might still result in a local eventBus if the remote-forwarding feature is configured to be "off" for the given topic name or
 * login-user, or in general.
