	 * About possible relations
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>an aggregator may create more than one {@link IInvoiceLineRW} for one {@link I_C_Invoice_Candidate}, i.e.<br/>
	 * <code>{(c1, il1), (c1, il2)}</code> is a legal relation</li>
	 * <li>an aggregator might aggregate more than one I_C_Invoice_Candidate into one IInvoiceLine, i.e.<br/>
	 * <code>{(c1, il1), (c2, il1)}</code> (that's the original reason we called it "aggregator")</li>
	 * <li>it is also allowed to have a combination of the two, i.e. something like<br/>
	 * <code>{(c1, il1), (c1, il2), (c2, il1), (c2, il2)}</code></li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * Note
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>the method assumes that every (ic, il) pair is associated only once
	 * <li>the method also sets the qty allocated between the given ic and il to be the {@link IInvoiceLineRW#getQtysToInvoice() QtysToInvoice} value of the given <code>il</code>. See
	 * {@link #getAllocatedQty(I_C_Invoice_Candidate, IInvoiceLineRW)}.
