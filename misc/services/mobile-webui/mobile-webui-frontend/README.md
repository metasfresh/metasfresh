## PWA

## Notes:
  You cannot test the service worker in 'developer' mode. This works only in prod

  For developers to test the results of the service-worker they can use the serve tool

  https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve

  Once this is installed you can run `yarn build`:

  then `serve -s build`
