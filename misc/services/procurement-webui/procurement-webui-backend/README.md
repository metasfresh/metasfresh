# metasfresh-procurement-webui

The metasfresh procurement webui is a standalone mobile web application that communicates with metasfresh and allows producers/ vendors to report supplies.

Those supply reports are transferred to metasfresh ERP and then transformed into the procurement candidates data structure. A metasfresh user - this could be a usere from purchase/ procurement - checks the reported data for a given supply date and generates purchase orders.

The webui leans on the following components to do its job:

* vaadin
* spring-boot
* rabbitmq
