     * Add an Evidence File
     *
     * This method is used by the seller to add one or more evidence files to address a payment dispute initiated by the buyer. The unique identifier of the payment dispute is passed in as a path parameter, and unique identifiers for payment disputes can be retrieved with the getPaymentDisputeSummaries method. Note: All evidence files should be uploaded using addEvidence and updateEvidence before the seller decides to contest the payment dispute. Once the seller has officially contested the dispute (using contestPaymentDispute or through My eBay), the addEvidence and updateEvidence methods can no longer be used. In the evidenceRequests array of the getPaymentDispute response, eBay prompts the seller with the type of evidence file(s) that will be needed to contest the payment dispute. The file(s) to add are identified through the files array in the request payload. Adding one or more new evidence files for a payment dispute triggers the creation of an evidence file, and the unique identifier for the new evidence file is automatically generated and returned in the evidenceId field of the addEvidence response payload upon a successful call. The type of evidence being added should be specified in the evidenceType field. All files being added (if more than one) should correspond to this evidence type. Upon a successful call, an evidenceId value is returned in the response. This indicates that a new evidence set has been created for the payment dispute, and this evidence set includes the evidence file(s) that were passed in to the fileId array. The evidenceId value will be needed if the seller wishes to add to the evidence set by using the updateEvidence method, or if they want to retrieve a specific evidence file within the evidence set by using the fetchEvidenceContent method.

The unique identifier of the payment dispute is passed in as a path parameter, and unique identifiers for payment disputes can be retrieved with the getPaymentDisputeSummaries method.

In the evidenceRequests array of the getPaymentDispute response, eBay prompts the seller with the type of evidence file(s) that will be needed to contest the payment dispute. If a seller decides to contest a payment dispute, that seller should be prepared to provide evidential documents such as proof of delivery, proof of authentication, or other documents. The type of evidential documents that the seller will provide will depend on why the buyer initiated the payment dispute. The revision field in the request payload is required, and the returnAddress field should be supplied if the seller is expecting the buyer to return the item.

The unique identifier of the evidence set to update is specified through the evidenceId field, and the file(s) to add are identified through the files array in the request payload. The unique identifier for an evidence file is automatically generated and returned in the fileId field of the uploadEvidence response payload upon a successful call. Sellers must make sure to capture the fileId value for each evidence file that is uploaded with the uploadEvidence method. The type of evidence being added should be specified in the evidenceType field. All files being added (if more than one) should correspond to this evidence type. Upon a successful call, an http status code of 204 Success is returned. There is no response payload unless an error occurs. To verify that a new file is a part of the evidence set, the seller can use the fetchEvidenceContent method, passing in the proper evidenceId and fileId values.
