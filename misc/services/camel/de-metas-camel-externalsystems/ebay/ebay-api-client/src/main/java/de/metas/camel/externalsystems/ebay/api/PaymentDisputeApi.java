	 * @param orderId This filter is used if the seller wishes to retrieve one or more payment disputes filed against a specific order. It is possible that there can be more than one dispute filed against an order if the order has multiple line items. If this filter is used, any other filters are ignored. Note: The order identifier passed into this field must be an Order ID in the new format. The
	 *            legacy APIs still support the old and new order ID format to identify orders, but only the new order ID format is supported in REST-based APIs. eBay rolled out a new Order ID format in June 2019. (optional)
	 * @param buyerUsername This filter is used if the seller wishes to retrieve one or more payment disputes opened by a specific seller. The string that is passed in to this query parameter is the eBay user ID of the buyer. (optional)
	 * @param openDateFrom The open_date_from and/or open_date_to date filters are used if the seller wishes to retrieve payment disputes opened within a specific date range. A maximum date range that may be set with the open_date_from and/or open_date_to filters is 90 days. These date filters use the ISO-8601 24-hour date and time format, and time zone used is Universal Coordinated Time (UTC),
	 *            also known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or Zulu. The open_date_from field sets the beginning date of the date range, and can be set as far back as 18 months from the present time. If a open_date_from field is used, but a open_date_to field is not used, the open_date_to value will default to 90 days after the date specified in the open_date_from field, or to the present time if
	 *            less than 90 days in the past. The ISO-8601 format looks like this: yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm.ss.sssZ. An example would be 2019-08-04T19:09:02.768Z. (optional)
	 * @param openDateTo The open_date_from and/or open_date_to date filters are used if the seller wishes to retrieve payment disputes opened within a specific date range. A maximum date range that may be set with the open_date_from and/or open_date_to filters is 90 days. These date filters use the ISO-8601 24-hour date and time format, and the time zone used is Universal Coordinated Time (UTC),
	 *            also known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or Zulu. The open_date_to field sets the ending date of the date range, and can be set up to 90 days from the date set in the open_date_from field. The ISO-8601 format looks like this: yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm.ss.sssZ. An example would be 2019-08-04T19:09:02.768Z. (optional)
	 * @param paymentDisputeStatus This filter is used if the seller wishes to only retrieve payment disputes in a specific state. More than one value can be specified. If no payment_dispute_status filter is used, payment disputes in all states are returned in the response. See DisputeStateEnum type for supported values. (optional)
	 * @param limit The value passed in this query parameter sets the maximum number of payment disputes to return per page of data. The value passed in this field should be an integer from 1 to 200. If this query parameter is not set, up to 200 records will be returned on each page of results. Min: 1; Max: 200; Default: 200 (optional)
	 * @param offset This field is used to specify the number of records to skip in the result set before returning the first payment dispute in the paginated response. A zero-based index is used, so if you set the offset value to 0 (default value), the first payment dispute in the result set appears at the top of the response. Combine offset with the limit parameter to control the payment
	 *            disputes returned in the response. For example, if you supply an offset value of 0 and a limit value of 10, the response will contain the first 10 payment disputes from the result set that matches the input criteria. If you supply an offset value of 10 and a limit value of 20, the response will contain payment disputes 11-30 from the result set that matches the input criteria.
	 *            Min: 0; Max: total number of payment disputes - 1; Default: 0 (optional)

	 * This method is used retrieve one or more payment disputes filed against the seller. These payment disputes can be open or recently closed. The following filter types are available in the request payload to control the payment disputes that are returned: Dispute filed against a specific order (order_id parameter is used) Dispute(s) filed by a specific buyer (buyer_username parameter is used)
	 * Dispute(s) filed within a specific date range (open_date_from and/or open_date_to parameters are used) Disputes in a specific state (payment_dispute_status parameter is used)More than one of these filter types can be used together. See the request payload request fields for more information about how each filter is used. If none of the filters are used, all open and recently closed payment
	 * disputes are returned. Pagination is also available. See the limit and offset fields for more information on how pagination is used for this method.
	 * 
	 * @param orderId This filter is used if the seller wishes to retrieve one or more payment disputes filed against a specific order. It is possible that there can be more than one dispute filed against an order if the order has multiple line items. If this filter is used, any other filters are ignored. Note: The order identifier passed into this field must be an Order ID in the new format. The
	 *            legacy APIs still support the old and new order ID format to identify orders, but only the new order ID format is supported in REST-based APIs. eBay rolled out a new Order ID format in June 2019. (optional)
	 * @param buyerUsername This filter is used if the seller wishes to retrieve one or more payment disputes opened by a specific seller. The string that is passed in to this query parameter is the eBay user ID of the buyer. (optional)
	 * @param openDateFrom The open_date_from and/or open_date_to date filters are used if the seller wishes to retrieve payment disputes opened within a specific date range. A maximum date range that may be set with the open_date_from and/or open_date_to filters is 90 days. These date filters use the ISO-8601 24-hour date and time format, and time zone used is Universal Coordinated Time (UTC),
	 *            also known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or Zulu. The open_date_from field sets the beginning date of the date range, and can be set as far back as 18 months from the present time. If a open_date_from field is used, but a open_date_to field is not used, the open_date_to value will default to 90 days after the date specified in the open_date_from field, or to the present time if
	 *            less than 90 days in the past. The ISO-8601 format looks like this: yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm.ss.sssZ. An example would be 2019-08-04T19:09:02.768Z. (optional)
	 * @param openDateTo The open_date_from and/or open_date_to date filters are used if the seller wishes to retrieve payment disputes opened within a specific date range. A maximum date range that may be set with the open_date_from and/or open_date_to filters is 90 days. These date filters use the ISO-8601 24-hour date and time format, and the time zone used is Universal Coordinated Time (UTC),
	 *            also known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or Zulu. The open_date_to field sets the ending date of the date range, and can be set up to 90 days from the date set in the open_date_from field. The ISO-8601 format looks like this: yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm.ss.sssZ. An example would be 2019-08-04T19:09:02.768Z. (optional)
	 * @param paymentDisputeStatus This filter is used if the seller wishes to only retrieve payment disputes in a specific state. More than one value can be specified. If no payment_dispute_status filter is used, payment disputes in all states are returned in the response. See DisputeStateEnum type for supported values. (optional)
	 * @param limit The value passed in this query parameter sets the maximum number of payment disputes to return per page of data. The value passed in this field should be an integer from 1 to 200. If this query parameter is not set, up to 200 records will be returned on each page of results. Min: 1; Max: 200; Default: 200 (optional)
	 * @param offset This field is used to specify the number of records to skip in the result set before returning the first payment dispute in the paginated response. A zero-based index is used, so if you set the offset value to 0 (default value), the first payment dispute in the result set appears at the top of the response. Combine offset with the limit parameter to control the payment
	 *            disputes returned in the response. For example, if you supply an offset value of 0 and a limit value of 10, the response will contain the first 10 payment disputes from the result set that matches the input criteria. If you supply an offset value of 10 and a limit value of 20, the response will contain payment disputes 11-30 from the result set that matches the input criteria.
	 *            Min: 0; Max: total number of payment disputes - 1; Default: 0 (optional)

	 * Update evidence
	 * This method is used by the seller to update an existing evidence set for a payment dispute with one or more evidence files. The unique identifier of the payment dispute is passed in as a path parameter, and unique identifiers for payment disputes can be retrieved with the getPaymentDisputeSummaries method. Note: All evidence files should be uploaded using addEvidence and updateEvidence
	 * before the seller decides to contest the payment dispute. Once the seller has officially contested the dispute (using contestPaymentDispute or through My eBay), the addEvidence and updateEvidence methods can no longer be used. In the evidenceRequests array of the getPaymentDispute response, eBay prompts the seller with the type of evidence file(s) that will be needed to contest the payment
	 * dispute. The unique identifier of the evidence set to update is specified through the evidenceId field, and the file(s) to add are identified through the files array in the request payload. The unique identifier for an evidence file is automatically generated and returned in the fileId field of the uploadEvidence response payload upon a successful call. Sellers must make sure to capture the
	 * fileId value for each evidence file that is uploaded with the uploadEvidence method. The type of evidence being added should be specified in the evidenceType field. All files being added (if more than one) should correspond to this evidence type. Upon a successful call, an http status code of 204 Success is returned. There is no response payload unless an error occurs. To verify that a new
	 * file is a part of the evidence set, the seller can use the fetchEvidenceContent method, passing in the proper evidenceId and fileId values.

	 * Upload an Evidence File
	 * This method is used to upload an evidence file for a contested payment dispute.

	 * have a request payload. The three image formats supported at this time are .JPEG, .JPG, and .PNG. Once the file is successfully uploaded, the seller will need to grab the fileId value in the response payload to add this file to a new evidence set using the addEvidence method, or to add this file to an existing evidence set using the updateEvidence method.
