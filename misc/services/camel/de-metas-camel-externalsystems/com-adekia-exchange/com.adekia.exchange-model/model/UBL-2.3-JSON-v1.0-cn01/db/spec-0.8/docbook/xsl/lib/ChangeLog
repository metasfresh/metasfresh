	* lib.xweb: Added prepend-pad function for right-padding strings to a specific
	length.

2005-06-28  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lib.xweb: Fixed typo.

2005-06-27  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lib.xweb: Added an "apply-string-subst-map" function (template). Only
	difference is that in the map that it expects, "oldstring" and
	"newstring" attributes are used instead of "character" and
	"string" attributes.

2005-06-22  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lib.xweb: Finalized read-character-map() and apply-character-map() functions.

2005-06-18  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lib.xweb: Added initial versions of replace-chars-with-strings() and
	apply-character-map() functions. These are intended mainly for use
	in the manpages stylesheets but may be useful elsewhere too.
	
	I need to fix the logic in the manpages stylesheet so that the
	character-map file is read only once per document. The way it is
	now, the character map is read each time a refentry is found,
	which is a big waste.

	* lib.xweb: Make handling of date format strings more robust (closes #1206837).
	
	::Problem:
	  If the "dbtimestamp" PI has words in it that contain any of the
	  single-letter characters used as date/time formatting
	  instructions, the output is not what would be expected.
	
	  For example, Spanish "long" dates look like this:
	
	    23 de mayo de 2005
	
	  So you would expect that you could generate a date of that form
	  using the dbtimestamp PI with a format string like the following:
	
	    <?dbtimestamp format="d de B de Y"?>
	
	  But if you try that, you get the following output:
	
	    23 23e mayo 23e 2005
	
	  That is, the "d" in "de" is replaced with the day of the month.
	
	::Cause::
	  The format-string parsing logic works by walking through the
	  format string character-by-character. So when it gets to the "d"
	  in "de", it has no way of discerning that it is not the "d"
	  formatting instruction but is instead part of a word intended to
	  be included in the output as a literal string.
	
	::Fix::
	  The format-string parsing logic now splits format strings into
	  tokens and delimiters and evaluates them token-by-token instead
	  of character-by-character.
	
	  For example, it splits the Spanish "long" date format like this:
	
	    <token>d</token> <token>de</token> <token>B</token> ...
	
	  Thus, in looking for the "d" formatting instruction, the "d"
	  token matches but the "de" token does not.
	
	  As delimiters, it recognizes the following characters:
	
	    <space> <tab> <CR> <LF> , . / - ( ) [ ]
	
	::Affects:
	  This change affects output of the "dbtimestamp" PI as well as
	  output from any customization layers that call the
	  "datetime.format" template. It affect all formats (HTML, FO, etc.).

2003-03-26  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile: branches:  1.5.2;
	wdocbook.xsl obsoleted by w2docbook.xsl, updated globally

	* Makefile: reverting wdocbook.xsl -> w2docbook.xsl changes

2003-03-05  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile: 
	
	Wrong filename was breaking build, fixed.
	
	  Had ../../litprog/wdocbook.xsl but needed ../../litprog/w2docbook.xsl

2002-09-15  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lib.xweb: Fix bug where PIs match the suffix of a name instead of the whole name

2002-06-09  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lib.xweb: Fix bug #496453: make sure comments don't contain illegal chars

2002-05-12  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lib.xweb: Changed default units to px; added length-in-points template

2002-03-25  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* .cvsignore: Ignore lib.xsl too

	* .cvsignore, Makefile, lib.xsl, lib.xweb: Use Literate XML to generate lib.xsl

	* Makefile: Update documentation build to reflect use of lib.xweb

2002-03-18  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lib.xsl: Replace generate.*.toc and generate.*.lot with single generate.toc parameter.

2002-03-14  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lib.xsl: Whitespace only: change CR/LF back to LF. Norm was a total moron.

	* lib.xsl: Whitespace changes only: use PC-style CR/LF because Unix clients choke on this far less often than PC clients choke on the reverse. Grrr.

2002-01-09  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lib.xsl: Added length-units template to extract units from lengths

2001-11-28  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>
