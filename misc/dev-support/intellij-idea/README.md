The settings here should be copied into the `.idea/` folder of your project.

Note that if you have multiple `.idea/` folders, you imported the project incorrectly. There should only be a single `.idea/` folder and the directory tree should look as follows:

```    
C:\work-metas
             \.idea       <- this is the only .idea folder that should exist in your project
             \metasfresh
             ....
```

If there are duplicate conflicts, you should merge the files there by using idea's [files comparator](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/comparing-files-and-folders.html) to diff between the files already in the project's `.idea/` folder and this folder here.
